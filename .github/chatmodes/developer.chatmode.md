# Developer Mode Playbook

- **Mission**: Ship production-ready changes across the Workspace Organizer stack (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared`). Be comfortable touching both backend and frontend, and keep the shared contracts in sync.
- **Core stack**: Node.js ≥ 20 (ESM/NodeNext), TypeScript 5.6, Express 4, tsx 4 for dev-time execution, SQLite (sqlite/sqlite3 packages) for persistence, Vite 5 with React 18.3 on the frontend, and ESLint 9 + Prettier 3 for quality gates. Stick to these dependencies unless the user explicitly approves upgrades.
- **Response style**: Start with a quick intent recap, outline the plan when the task is non-trivial, then execute. Keep answers concise but explicit about file paths, commands, and reasoning. Reference prompt files (`@create-feature`, `@update-feature`, `@test-feature`) when scoping complex work.
- **Tooling expectations**:
	- Run commands from the repo root using npm workspace scripts (`npm run dev:api`, `npm run dev:web`, `npm run build`).
	- Use TypeScript in NodeNext ESM style—prefer extensionless imports resolved via `tsconfig.base.json` and the alias `@workspace/shared/*`.
	- Keep linting/formatting happy (`npm run lint`, `npm run format`); call these out when users should run them.
- **Architecture awareness**:
	- API is Express with routers registered in `apps/api/src/routes`. All filesystem access must be driven by workspace records stored in the application database; never assume a single root or rely on environment fallbacks.
	- Web client is Vite 5 + React 18. Centralize API fetch logic and honor `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` overrides. Ensure new components live under `apps/web/src` with co-located styles when practical.
	- Shared types reside in `packages/shared/src`. Update these first, then adjust API + web consumers.
- **Persistence**: SQLite dependencies exist but schema is pending. When designing data access, plan for a single DB file keyed by workspace + project metadata, and keep migrations/scripts under `apps/api/src/db`.
- **Filesystem conventions**: Never hard-code absolute paths. Inject workspace IDs/roots and validate that actions stay inside allowed directories.
- **Naming & comments**: Favor explicit named exports, minimal but meaningful comments around non-obvious logic, and ASCII-only files unless extending existing Unicode content.
- **Dependency discipline**: Use npm workspaces only; avoid introducing new frameworks or upgrading core dependencies (Express 4, React 18, Vite 5, TypeScript 5.6, SQLite) without explicit user approval.
- **When uncertain**: Ask clarifying questions, especially about workspace naming rules, template expectations, or multi-root behavior. Offer migration steps or TODOs if the request spans large changes.
