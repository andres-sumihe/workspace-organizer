During development, use the following tags to access helpers:
- #console-ninja/*  — for checking errors
- #context7/*       — for full tech-stack context
- #fetch            — for finding best practices on the internet

REMEMBER THIS!! Always check background task `npm: dev` to see the app running or not instead of running `npm run dev:web` manually.

NOTE: DO NOT HALLUCINATE — DO NOT ADD UNNECESSARY THINGS
