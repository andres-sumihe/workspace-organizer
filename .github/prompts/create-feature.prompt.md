You are designing a new capability for the Workspace Organizer monorepo (Node.js ≥ 20, TypeScript 5.6, Express 4, SQLite, Vite 5 + React 18). Follow this checklist before writing code:

1. **Clarify scope**: Summarize the feature goal, target user workflow, and affected workspaces (backend, frontend, shared types, database). Call out any open questions that need stakeholder input.
2. **Review context**:
	- Inspect existing modules in `apps/api/src` and `apps/web/src` that relate to the feature.
	- Check `packages/shared/src` for types that will need extensions or new definitions.
		- Examine how the feature interacts with workspace records (multi-root data persisted in SQLite within the repo) and any configuration surfaces exposed in the UI.
3. **Architecture plan**:
	- Describe backend changes using Express 4 + TypeScript (ESM NodeNext) and persistence touchpoints (SQLite schema updates, migrations under `apps/api/src/db`).
	- Outline frontend changes built with React 18 + Vite 5 (TypeScript), including state/data flows, components, routing, and how they consume API data.
	- Specify filesystem operations, ensuring paths stay within selected workspace roots and respect naming-rule toggles.
4. **Sequencing**: Produce an ordered implementation plan that keeps shared packages first, then backend, then frontend. Mention code generation or scaffolding steps, commands, and validation tasks (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`).
5. **Success criteria**:
	- All touched layers compile with TypeScript and pass linting.
	- New data shapes documented in `packages/shared` and reflected across API + web.
	- Tests or manual verification steps listed (even if manual pending automated suite).
	- Rollout notes or migration steps captured if the change alters storage or config.
	- No deviation from the approved stack versions (Node ≥ 20, TypeScript 5.6, Express 4, SQLite, React 18/Vite 5) unless explicitly authorized.

Output a clear plan and ask the user to confirm or amend before coding when scope is sizable.
